              <p>
                The domestic dog is an extremely social animal and offers a diverse variety of
                choices as there are well over 300 breeds recognized by the World Canine
                Organization. Adopting a dog offers mutual benefits between dog and owner. Many
                studies cite the social benefits of having a companion as well as the reduced
                feelings of loneliness from adopting a dog. Studies even show medical indicators
                such as
                <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.119.005554">
                  <strong> blood pressure and improved lipid profiles. </strong>
                </a>
                If you have a dog, it is important to make sure that you care for your dog; be
                mindful of what you feed your dog and provide enough opportunities for exercise. In
                this page, you will find more information about how to care for your pets throughout
                the various stages of their lives.

                    Throughout dogs’ lifespans, they should generally be fed fewer meals as they
                    mature. Puppies should be nursed the first two months, then introduced to three
                    meals per day when they are about three to six months years old. Their food
                    intake should be reduced to two meals per day when they are six months to one
                    year old and finally reduced to one meal after they reach one year old. And a
                    dog’s typical body mass is composed of somewhere between 60 and 70 percent
                    water. The
                    <a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/dog-care/dog-nutrition-tips"
                      ><strong>ASPCA</strong></a
                    >
                    says just a 10 percent decrease in body water can cause illness, and a 15
                    percent loss can cause death, so make sure you keep your pooch hydrated!
                  </li>
                  <li class="list-group-item">
                    Much like humans, dogs need to have a healthy level of activity to keep their
                    organs healthy, as well as sun and fresh air. The minimum recommended time for
                    exercise varies greatly with breed and size differences, but generally a range
                    of 30–120 minutes of exercise is recommended per day! Can you imagine exercising
                    two hours per day? OK, I know that wouldn't bother some of you reading this. But
                    the thought of it to me makes me cringe! And by the way, exercising your dog
                    does not mean you are being challenged to a push-up contest. Brisk walks are OK
                    too! You can also choose from a variety of toys to encourage physical activity;
                    just be sure they are age appropriate and do not pose a choking hazard. Pay
                    careful attention to toys that require supervision.

                    Keeping your furry family member clean is important to its health. So be sure to
                    brush frequently to reduce the amount of shedding and prevent matted and tangled
                    fur that can prove to be extremely difficult to remove. Check for insects such
                    as ticks and fleas, especially after visiting heavily wooded areas.

                  <li class="list-group-item">
                    Bathing is not only important to your dog’s health but can be an exercise
                    depending on how strong willed the dog is. Rinse all of the soap out, as any
                    residual soap can result in a rash. Be sure the soap is formulated for your
                    puppy or dog, since harsh soaps can cause allergic reactions.
                  </li>
                  <li class="list-group-item">
                    And as always, be careful how you handle your loved one. No matter the size of
                    your dog, you need to be cautious as you carry your canine. If you have a small
                    dog, then cradle the pup with one hand under the chest and the forearm
                    supporting the back half. If it is a large dog, reach under the belly with both
                    your arms perpendicular to the dog, and use each arm to support the chest and
                    rear as you lift.

                You should always consult with your veterinarian, but there is a core set of
                vaccines that are typically recommended. Vaccines that reduce the exposure risk to
                things such as hepatitis, rabies, and parvovirus. Others may be determined by your
                vet depending on the environment in which the dog resides. Some of these include
